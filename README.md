[a] Counting DNA

using [dictionary] and [collections & Counter] function to count bases; 'A','C','G','T'

[b] Transcribing DNA into RNA

DNa -> RNA (replacing 'T' with 'U') using [replace] function

[c] Complementary and reverse complementary DNA string

using [dictionary] and slicing [::-1] to populate a string's complementary and reverse complementary string

[d] Fibonacci rabbit offspring

working with Fibonacci to calculate pairs of rabbits reporduction

[e] GC content

open and read sequencing result data, and caclulate GC %

[f] Hamming distance counting point mutation

compare two different strings to find out differecnes which represent mutation
(In order to make Hamming distance work, the two differenct strings have to be the same length)

[g] Mendels first law dominant

find out probability of dominant phenotype among homozygous dominant & heterozygous & homozygous recessive
homo_D = PP / hetero = Pp / homo_R = pp

[h] Translating RNA into protein

sets of 3 RNA bases into corresponding protein, using textwrap & wrap function and for loop to convert the RNA bases into proteins

[i] Finding a Motif in DNA

find a target sequence in a given DNA string using for loop and slicing, return their locations
