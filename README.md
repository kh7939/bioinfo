[1] Counting DNA

using [dictionary] and [collections & Counter] function to count bases; 'A','C','G','T'

[2] Transcribing DNA into RNA

DNa -> RNA (replacing 'T' with 'U') using [replace] function

[3] Complementary and reverse complementary DNA string

using [dictionary] and slicing [::-1] to populate a string's complementary and reverse complementary string

[4] Fibonacci rabbit offspring

working with Fibonacci to caclculate pairs of rabbits reporduction

[5] GC content

open and read sequencing result data, and caclulate GC %

[6] Hamming distance counting point mutation

compare two different strings to find out differecnes which represent mutation
*In order to make Hammind distance work, the two differenct strings have to be the same length*

[7] Mendels first law dominant

find out probability of dominant phenotype among homozygous dominant & heterozygous & homozygous recessive
homo_D = PP / hetero = Pp / homo_R = pp

[8] Translating RNA into protein

sets of 3 RNA bases into corresponding protein, using textwrap & wrap function and for loop to convert the RNA bases into proteins
